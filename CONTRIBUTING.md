## Before Contributing

- Please check existing [issues](../../issues) before creating a new one

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code, add appropriate tests
3. Ensure your code follows the project's style guidelines
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Submit your pull request with a clear description of the changes

## Code Review Process

Please note that this is maintained by a small team, so review times may vary. We aim to review pull requests as quickly as possible, but it may take a few days.

If there are multiple pull requests addressing the same issue, we will review them all but merge the one that:
- Best follows coding standards and best practices
- Provides the most complete and relevant solution
- Includes proper tests and documentation
